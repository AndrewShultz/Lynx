#First change the DRIVER define in ybacklight.c to correct driver. See: /sys/class/backlight/ to figure out driver.

#then use:

sudo visudo

#then add as last line:

'''USERNAME''' ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /full/path/ybacklight

Lastly, add commands:

/full/path/ybacklight -inc 5
/home/andrew/Software/c++/ybacklight/src/ybacklight -dec 5

to hotkeys (keyboard settings).
